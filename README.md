# Introduction
WebApp behind the Tapkey-OSS-MA demo showcased at the Light + Building 2022 Fair.

The app offers a page that allows users to sign up for the demo. The registered data includes the user's email addresses. On submit an OSS Credential ID will be generated for the user. A mobile credential will be created for the user, giving access to preconfigured locking devices showcased at the fair.

The app makes use of Tapkey's OSS Interface A implementation, which is available at https://ossapi.tapkey.io. At the time of publication, the standard has not been officially released, so the app is based on a preliminary version of the standard.

The showcase is available at https://ossdemo.tapkey.io.
